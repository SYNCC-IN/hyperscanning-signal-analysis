    """Assign slow/fast bands via seeded, power-weighted k-means over specparam peaks.

    Operates on the raw specparam peaks for ONE participant at ONE ROI (all
    channels' peaks pooled), NOT on pre-clustered peaks. This replaces the
    greedy within-ROI clustering for the band-assignment path: greedy
    clustering (tolerance 1.0 Hz) can leave one true oscillation split
    across adjacent peaks, which a subsequent power-based "two strongest"
    selection then discards. Seeded k-means instead reassigns every peak by
    proximity to a power-weighted center of mass, merging noise-split peaks
    around the true center.

    Peaks are first restricted to ``[slow_cf_range[0], fast_cf_range[1]]``;
    peaks outside are discarded. Up to two centers are seeded, one from
    ``slow_cf_range`` and one from ``fast_cf_range``: the seed is the
    candidate peak in that range whose center_freq is closest to the
    range's midpoint (ties broken by higher power, then lower center_freq)
    — not the highest-power peak in the range. A loud peak sitting right at
    the shared boundary is plausible fast-rhythm content mislabeled by
    range membership alone, and seeding from it would anchor the slow
    cluster on the wrong peak; a midpoint-proximity seed instead picks a
    prototype location for the band and lets the nearest-center assignment
    below sort boundary-adjacent peaks into whichever cluster they actually
    belong to. Every kept peak (regardless of which range it originally
    fell in) is then assigned to its nearest center by absolute frequency
    distance, centers are recomputed as the power-weighted mean center_freq
    of their members, and this repeats until membership stops changing or
    ``max_iter`` is reached. Ties in nearest-center go to cluster index 0
    (seeded from the slow range), a fixed, deterministic rule. After
    convergence the lower of the two final centers is labelled slow, the
    higher fast; the power-weighted center is kept as-is even if it drifts
    outside its seeding range.

    If only one seed exists (no peak in the other range), or if the k-means
    partition collapses so every peak lands in one cluster, all kept peaks
    are pooled into a single band, labelled by comparing its final center
    to the shared boundary ``slow_cf_range[1]`` (== ``fast_cf_range[0]``).
    If both centers survive but their final gap is below ``min_gap``, the
    two clusters are deemed one rhythm: only the higher-summed-power
    cluster is kept (its own members' peaks), labelled the same way.

    For each returned band, the window is ``[cf - bw, cf + bw]`` where
    ``cf`` is the power-weighted mean center_freq of its members and
    ``bw = max(cf - min_edge, max_edge - cf)``, with ``min_edge`` /
    ``max_edge`` the min/max of each member's ``center_freq - bandwidth`` /
    ``center_freq + bandwidth`` — so the window covers every merged peak's
    own extent.

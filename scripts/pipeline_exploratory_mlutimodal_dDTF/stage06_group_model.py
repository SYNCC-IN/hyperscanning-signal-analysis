"""Stage 6 - group model: Delta ffDTF vs surrogate (H2/H4).

Stage 5 is done and untouched: for every real dyad x film x edge it wrote a
signed `delta_dtf` and `z_vs_surrogate` against a film-matched surrogate null
(`Interbrain_ffDTF_analysis/05_surrogate/stage05_delta_table.csv`, 1512 rows =
42 dyads x 3 films x 12 edges). Stage 6 fits the group-level Bayesian model(s)
on that tidy table and answers H2 (caregiver->child TPJ coupling, reduced in
ASD?) and H4 (caregiver->child HRV co-regulation, altered in ASD -- sign not
assumed). `delta_dtf`/`z_vs_surrogate` stay SIGNED everywhere in every output
of this stage too -- never `abs()` or clipped.

Locked decisions (L1-L9) -- implemented as stated, not silently resolved
differently:

- L1: DV = `delta_dtf` (standardized per edge, D3), Student-t family for
  robustness to outliers. `z_vs_surrogate` is modelled too, but ONLY for the
  asymmetry track (L6) -- never for the plain per-edge models, and never
  `abs()`-ed either DV.
- L2: fixed effects `film * group`, sum-to-zero contrasts on both (`C(.,
  Sum)`) so `group` reads as a main effect and the interaction stays clean.
  `film` is a 3-level valence factor (Peppa/Incredibles/Brave), NOT an
  ordered scale -- never averaged across films as if it were one.
- L3: planned contrast `Incredibles vs (Peppa+Brave)/2`, reported two-sided
  (posterior mean, 95% HDI, `P(>0)` and `P(<0)`), overall and within each
  group. Bambi has no `brms::hypothesis()`/`emmeans` equivalent, so this
  script computes it the estimated-marginal-means way: predict the six
  film x group cell means at the population level
  (`include_group_specific=False`) and take linear combinations of those
  posterior draws -- algebraically identical to a contrast on the fixed
  effects, and it generalises cleanly to the interaction test.
- L4: inference = posterior mean, 95% HDI, and directional posterior
  probability `P(effect>0)`/`P(effect<0)` for every reported contrast. No
  p-values as the primary object (see L7 for the one supplementary
  exception).
- L5: confirmatory edge set = the 6 Stage-5 emphasis edges (H2_primary,
  H2_reverse, H4_primary, H4_reverse, and the 2 exploratory cross
  brain-heart edges). The 6 "other" edges are not modelled by default
  (`FIT_OTHER_EDGES` toggle below).
- L6: asymmetry track. For H2 and H4, `asym = value(primary) -
  value(reverse)` per dyad x film, same `film*group + (1|dyad_id)`
  structure. Primary DV = `z_vs_surrogate` (scale-free, robust to the
  child/adult maturation artefact); `delta_dtf` (standardized) is a
  sensitivity model. Intercept (== grand mean over the 6 film x group cells,
  read off the same posterior-prediction machinery as L3) `> 0` means
  caregiver-leading.
- L7: mild BH-FDR across the PRIMARY family only = {H2_primary group effect,
  H4_primary group effect} -- kept deliberately small and named
  (`PRIMARY_FAMILY` below). Feeds `2*min(P(>0),P(<0))`, an analog p-value
  documented as such, into `src.group_model.bh_fdr`. Reported as a
  supplementary column beside the Bayesian summary, never as the primary
  inference. Exploratory edges get no correction.
- L8: drop `real_stable == False` rows before fitting; report the drop count
  per model even when it is zero (currently: zero for every edge -- a
  visible no-op, not a silent one).
- L9: 4 chains, `DRAWS` post-warmup draws/chain (>= ~2000), `target_accept`
  starting at 0.95, fixed seed. Pass criteria: max Rhat < 1.01, min bulk/tail
  ESS > 400, zero divergences (else the count is reported, not hidden), a
  sane `pp_check`, LOO Pareto-k mostly < 0.7. No silent retry ladder: a
  model that fails L9 is reported as failing in the diagnostics table and the
  gate, which is the trigger to consider the 2-variable fallback -- not
  something this script patches on its own.

Open decisions (D0-D5) -- default implemented, alternative documented:

- D0: engine. The plan's literal contract names `stage06_group_model.R` +
  brms `hypothesis()`. Checked before writing any code: `brms`/`rstan`/
  `cmdstanr` are NOT installed in this environment's R, while `bambi` (0.17.2)
  and `arviz` (0.23.4) already are in `.venv`. Per this prompt's own
  instruction ("if the chosen engine is not installed, stop and say so"),
  this was surfaced to the project owner, who chose **Bambi + ArviZ**. This
  single Python script therefore does both the fit and the gate (keeping one
  toolchain, per the D0 Python-engine branch), reusing `src/group_model.py`
  for the pieces that don't involve MCMC. The output contract (tidy CSVs +
  PNGs + gate) is identical to what the brms branch would have produced.
- D1 (CORRECTNESS FIX): the plan/note formula is `(1|dyad_id) + (1|child_id)
  + (1|caregiver_id)`, but in this design child and caregiver are 1:1 with
  dyad (no member appears in more than one dyad) -- the three grouping
  factors are the same partition of the rows, so the three variance
  components are not jointly identifiable. Collapsed to `(1|dyad_id)` only
  (42 groups x 3 films per edge, a clean repeated-measures term). Surfaced
  in the run summary and the gate header for Jarek to ratify or override.
- D2: per-edge models (default, confirmatory) vs one pooled cross-edge model
  with `+ (1|edge)` partial pooling across the 6 emphasis edges
  (`FIT_POOLED_MODEL`, default True) as a shrinkage companion/cross-check --
  it does not replace the per-edge results.
- D3: `delta_dtf` is tiny (~1e-4 to 1e-3); standardized per edge (z-score
  across that edge's kept rows) before fitting, with explicit
  weakly-informative priors on the standardized scale (Intercept, fixed
  effects ~ Normal(0,1); group/edge SD, sigma ~ half-Student-t(3,0,1)).
  Contrasts are reported in standardized units and back-transformed to raw
  Delta-units (`unit` column). `z_vs_surrogate` (already ~unit scale) is
  modelled on its native scale with the same prior set, `unit="native"`.
- D4: baseline model (no covariate) is primary. `ADD_AGE_COVARIATE` /
  `ADD_IAF_COVARIATE` toggle sensitivity models adding mean-centred
  `age_months` and/or the dyadic `iaf_distance` column of
  `Exploratory_spectral_analysis/04_band_assignment/iaf_metrics.csv` (path
  and column name confirmed against the actual file before writing this
  script -- it does NOT live under `Interbrain_ffDTF_analysis/`). A missing
  file/column when a toggle is on errors loudly; no silent skip.
- D5: no expected sign is encoded for the H4 group effect --
  `P(ASD>TD)`/`P(ASD<TD)` are always reported symmetrically.

Hand-off note (not a Stage 6 decision, just a flag): `pipeline_plan.md` Stage
6 and `notatka_projekt_DTF_HRV_H2_H4.md` still describe the group model with
the stale three-term RE formula this script corrects via D1 -- worth fixing
in those docs, not done here.

Writes `Interbrain_ffDTF_analysis/06_group/` per the module-level OUTPUT_DIR:
fitted `idata` per model (`models/*.nc`), `stage06_contrasts.csv`,
`stage06_diagnostics.csv`, `stage06_primary_summary.csv`, QC figures, and the
interactive `group_model_gate.html`.

# D6 (open, exploratory) -- cross-edge localization of the film x group
# interaction. Appended after the Stage 6 gate above; nothing above this line
# is touched.
#
# The pooled model (Section 4) found a credible film x group interaction in
# standardized units, while the per-edge H2_primary model shows none -- so
# the pooled interaction is a cross-edge signal that does not live on the
# primary H2 edge. This is NOT a two-stage omnibus-then-post-hoc test: the
# pooled fixed effect and any per-edge re-test would be separate estimators
# with no shared multiplicity protection (the classic forking-paths failure
# mode). Instead this fits one richer hierarchy that lets the film x group
# interaction vary by edge (M1, primary) and, as a heavier sensitivity check,
# lets the whole film*group surface vary by edge (M2, gated by
# `FIT_M2_FULL_VARYING`). Both are compared to the interaction-fixed pooled
# model (M0 = `pooled_model`/`pooled_idata` from Section 4, reused unrefit)
# via `az.compare` (LOO); per-edge localization is read off M1's shrunk
# group-specific deviations, warranted only if letting the interaction vary
# actually improves predictive fit.
#
# Caveats (surfaced again in the gate section below):
#  - Exploratory, uncorrected. The interaction was never in the L7 FDR family
#    (PRIMARY_FAMILY = the two H2/H4 GROUP effects only). Every quantity here
#    is hypothesis-generating, not confirmatory.
#  - Six edges is very little for a variance component -- the edge-level SD
#    is estimated from 6 groups, so per-edge deviations are heavily shrunk
#    and the `az.compare` ranking is low-powered. A "win" for the varying
#    model is weak evidence.
#  - `(...|edge)` treats the 6 emphasis edges as exchangeable, which is
#    scientifically questionable (interbrain-EEG, interbrain-HRV, and cross
#    brain-heart edges are qualitatively different objects). A typed
#    grouping could be more defensible -- flagged as an open modelling
#    choice, not resolved here.
#  - Standardized units only (`unit="std"`), same as the pooled model -- no
#    raw back-transform across edges with different raw scales.
#  - Signed everywhere. Never abs() or clip any interaction/contrast.

    Needed for M3 only: `edge` there is a common (fixed), Sum-coded term, not
    a `(...|edge)` group-specific one, so `reference_grid()` (no `edge`
    column at all) cannot be predicted from M3's formula and
    `include_group_specific=False` has nothing to switch off. Equal-weight
    averaging over Sum-coded levels exactly cancels the edge main effect and
    every edge interaction term (that is what Sum contrasts are for), so this
    reproduces the same population quantity `compute_contrasts` reads off
    directly for M1/M2 -- just via explicit marginalization instead of
    dropping a group-specific term.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : bambi.Model
    idata : arviz.InferenceData
    edges : list of str
        The edge categories to average over (the 6 emphasis edges).
    grid_categories : list of str
        `edge` categories exactly as used at fit time.

    Returns

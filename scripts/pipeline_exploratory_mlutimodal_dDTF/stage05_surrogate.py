"""Stage 5 - surrogate dyads, delta_dtf and z_vs_surrogate.

Stage 4 is done and untouched: for every `02_envelopes/<dyad>_<film>.nc` it
wrote a per-case ffDTF/spectra cube at that case's Stage-3-selected order
`p_used`. Those cubes remain the descriptive per-case estimate.

Stage 5 builds the group-model dependent variable: for every real
dyad x film x edge, `delta_dtf` and `z_vs_surrogate` against a film-matched
surrogate null (a foreign child + foreign caregiver who watched the same
film but were never in the room together). Subtracting the null removes the
common-stimulus + generic-physiology component and isolates genuine
interpersonal coupling. `delta_dtf`/`z_vs_surrogate` stay SIGNED everywhere
-- never `abs()` or clipped -- since the sign of what survives (especially on
HRV/H4) is scientifically meaningful.

Locked decisions (see `DTF_analysis_notes/pipeline_plan.md` Stage 5 -- honour,
do not silently resolve differently):

- L1: common model order `p=4` for every fit in this stage, real AND
  surrogate. ffDTF depends on order; Stage 3/4's per-case `p_used` varies
  across dyads, which would put each dyad's Delta baseline at a different
  order -- a confound in a group DV. Consequence: the real ffDTF entering
  Delta here is RECOMPUTED at p=4, not read from Stage 4's `.npz` cubes.
- L2: a surrogate is a re-paired design matrix (foreign child rows + foreign
  caregiver rows, same film) re-estimated through the exact Stage 4 path
  (`src.connectivity.Granger_estimator`) -- ffDTF is a joint 4-variable
  quantity and cannot be composed from two real cubes.
- L3: window geometry stays locked at Stage 3/4's values (10 s / 50 %
  overlap, linear per-window detrend) for real and surrogate alike. Each
  case's `03_mvar/<dyad>_<film>_order.json` `win_len`/`step`/`detrend_type`
  is asserted equal to the config constants below -- a consistency guard,
  since only `p` is deliberately overridden.
- L4: DV substrate = band-averaged ffDTF over the coupling band 0.2-1.0 Hz,
  same frequency grid as Stage 4 (100 pts, 0.02 Hz -> Nyquist - 0.02).
- L5: one pooled null per film x edge, shared across all dyads of that film,
  pooled across both groups (TD and ASD) -- group-agnostic so it cannot
  absorb the group effect the model tests. The pool includes surrogates that
  share one member with a given real dyad; that is standard and fine.
- L6: full ordered mismatched-pair set, `N*(N-1)` surrogates per film,
  deterministic, no random subsampling by default.
- L7: instability filter, explicit and counted. Each surrogate's windowed-ACF
  AR (p=4) is checked for companion-matrix stability
  (`windowed_ar_stability`); unstable surrogates are excluded from the null
  and the excluded count is reported per film. Real dyads are never dropped;
  their p=4 stability is recorded as `real_stable` and surfaced.
- L8: fixed variable order `DESIGN_VARIABLES` and
  `ffdtf[target, source, f]` (flow source->target) throughout, matching
  Stages 3/4. All 12 directed edges are computed; the scientifically named
  subset is tagged via `EDGE_CLASS` (H2/H4 primary+reverse, exploratory
  cross brain-heart, else "other").

Open decisions, surfaced here rather than resolved silently (see plan doc):

- D1: real value recomputed at p=4 (default, per L1) vs reusing Stage 4's
  `p_used` cube (rejected -- would mix orders in Delta).
- D2: null scope = film-wide pooled (default reference, L5) vs
  leave-one-dyad-out per real dyad. Only pooled is implemented; a
  leave-one-dyad-out scope would give a different null per dyad and break
  the one-null-per-film output contract -- not built here.
- D3: null pooling across groups (reference, L5) vs within group. BOTH are
  now run, controlled by `NULL_POOL_SCOPES=("film", "within_group")`. The
  pooled "film" null is the locked reference (its artifacts and CSV schema
  are byte-for-byte unchanged and Stage 6 consumes it). "within_group" is a
  SENSITIVITY: a same-group foreign-pair null, one per (film x group),
  written to `_within_group`-suffixed companion files. It exists because the
  pooled null is a group-invariant per-film scalar and therefore cancels out
  of every TD-vs-ASD contrast (group main effect AND film x group
  interaction) -- so it cannot separate genuine interpersonal coupling from a
  group-dependent stimulus response, which is exactly what the surviving
  interaction risks being. The within-group null subtracts each group's own
  stimulus/physiology baseline, so an interaction that survives it is genuine
  coupling. Requires n_g >= 2 dyads per (film x group) (asserted loudly);
  small groups yield few draws and a noisy z (surfaced via n_null).

Note for Stage 6 (not a Stage 5 decision): the plan's group-model formula
uses `(1|dyad) + (1|child) + (1|caregiver)`, but the envelope/order metadata
carries only `dyad_id` -- child and caregiver ids are 1:1 with dyad in this
design. Whether/how to expand crossed random-effect terms from `dyad_id` is
a Stage 6 modelling decision; Stage 5 simply carries `dyad_id`, `group`,
`age_months` in the tidy table.

Writes (reference "film" scope, unchanged), per film,
`05_surrogate/<film>_null.npz` (pooled null draws per edge, pairing metadata,
exclusion counts) and QC figures; per real dyad x film,
`05_surrogate/<dyad>_<film>_delta.npz` (delta/z per edge); across all cases,
the tidy hand-off table `05_surrogate/stage05_delta_table.csv`; and an
interactive QC gate (`surrogate_gate.html`).

Additionally, for the "within_group" (D3) sensitivity, per (film x group),
`<film>_<group>_null_within_group.npz` and QC histograms; per real dyad x
film, `<dyad>_<film>_delta_within_group.npz`; and the companion hand-off
table `stage05_delta_table_within_group.csv` (IDENTICAL column schema to the
reference table -- the null scope is in the filename, not a column, so Stage 6
runs unchanged on either). The gate gains a within-group sensitivity section.
The reference `.npz` files gain two provenance keys (`null_scope`,
`null_group`); their delta/z values and the reference CSV schema are
unchanged.

    Density-normalised (KDE), not a raw-count histogram: the surrogate null pool (hundreds
    to thousands of draws) vastly outnumbers real dyads (tens), so a count-based plot would
    make the null dwarf the real distributions regardless of effect size. Each of the three
    densities (null, TD, ASD) is independently normalised to unit area by `gaussian_kde`
    (area, not count), then all three share one width-scale constant -- so violin width
    reflects relative density, not sample size. The null (grey, both halves, should look
    roughly symmetric about its mean) sits in the background; TD occupies the left half and
    ASD the right half of the same y-scale, for an at-a-glance group-vs-group and
    group-vs-null read.

        If False (default), plot raw band-averaged estimator values. If True, shift every

        `delta_dtf` (`src.surrogate.delta_and_z`'s signed `real - median(null)`) instead of
        the raw value. The null violin is then centred on zero by construction; each real
        dyad's offset from zero IS its `delta_dtf`, read directly off the y-axis. Uses the
        median (matching `delta_and_z`), not the mean, so the delta shown here is exactly

<h1>Stage 5 surrogate gate</h1>
<p>estimator=<b>__ESTIMATOR__</b> (must match Stage 3/4's ESTIMATOR), box_cox_lambda=<b>__BOX_COX_LAMBDA__</b>
   (-1 = no transform; must match Stage 3/4's BOX_COX_LAMBDA),
   common model order=<b>p=__COMMON_MODEL_ORDER__</b> (real AND surrogate, L1/D1 -- NOT Stage 4's per-case p_used),
   window=<b>__WIN_LEN_S__ s / __OVERLAP_PCT__% overlap</b>, detrend=<b>__DETREND_TYPE__</b>,
   coupling_band=<b>__COUPLING_BAND__ Hz</b>, reference null_pool_scope=<b>__REFERENCE_SCOPE__</b> (L5: one pooled
   null per film, across TD+ASD; D2 leave-one-dyad-out not built), surrogate_stability_max_root=__STABILITY_MAX_ROOT__.
   delta_dtf and z_vs_surrogate are SIGNED everywhere -- never abs() or clipped.
   A <b>within-group null (D3) sensitivity</b> is reported in its own section below; the pooled null is a
   group-invariant per-film constant, so it cancels out of every TD-vs-ASD contrast (including the film x group
   interaction) -- only the within-group null can separate genuine interpersonal coupling from a group-dependent
   stimulus response.</p>
<h2>Pairing sanity</h2>
<div id="pairing">__PAIRING__</div>
<h2>Surrogate null vs real, per film</h2>
<div class="row">__NULL_HIST_IMAGES__</div>
<h2>delta_dtf: surrogate null (centred at zero) vs real, per film</h2>
<p>Same violins as above, shifted by each edge's own <code>-null_median</code> -- the null is centred on zero by
   construction and every real dyad's offset from zero IS its <code>delta_dtf</code> (signed, never abs()/clipped).</p>

<h2>Run summary</h2>

<div class="row"><img src="qc/delta_summary.png" alt="delta_dtf group summary"></div>
<h2>Sensitivity: within-group null (D3)</h2>
<p>Same-group foreign-pair null, one per (film x group). Subtracts each group's own shared-stimulus /
   generic-physiology baseline, so a film x group interaction that survives here is genuine interpersonal
   coupling, not the two groups responding to the same film differently. Watch the per-group kept counts:
   small groups give few surrogate draws and a noisy z. Re-run Stage 6 on
   <code>stage05_delta_table_within_group.csv</code> for the sensitivity result.</p>

"""Stage 2 - individual-band envelopes for the interbrain ffDTF + HRV pipeline.

Reads Stage 1's outputs (`Interbrain_ffDTF_analysis/01_coverage/`:
`dyad_selection.json`, `coverage.csv`) and, for every included dyad x film,
builds the four MVAR design variables -- `child:ROI`, `cg:ROI`, `child:HRV`,
`cg:HRV`:

- EEG variable (`*:ROI`): ROI-reduced fast-band amplitude envelope, using each
  participant's individual band from `band_assignments.csv`.
- HRV variable (`*:HRV`): the raw (interpolated) IBI signal, downsampled only
  -- no individualized band-pass, no Hilbert. This reverses the project note's
  original HF-envelope choice: on inspection of the real signals, the EEG
  rhythm envelopes fluctuate in a band that overlaps the raw IBI (RSA,
  ~0.2-1 Hz), whereas the HF-IBI envelope is a second-order, much slower
  signal that no longer sits in that band. Feeding the raw IBI keeps both
  modalities in a comparable band for the shared low-rate MVAR. The
  consequence (accepted explicitly, see `docs/pipeline_plan.md` Stage 2): the
  EEG side is a second-order quantity (amplitude envelope of a fast rhythm)
  while the HRV side is a first-order oscillation (the IBI itself) --
  internally consistent within each modality, but relevant to interpreting the
  exploratory cross brain-heart edges.

After downsampling, both continuous variables additionally pass through one
*shared* band-pass (`DESIGN_HIGHPASS_HZ`-`DESIGN_LOWPASS_HZ`, 2nd-order
Butterworth, `filtfilt`) -- the same filter for both, so any group delay
matches -- confirmed on inspection of the real PSDs: no interesting HRV
activity above ~0.8 Hz, plus visible VLF drift below ~0.05 Hz.

Both variables are computed on each role's whole continuous `passive_movies`
chunk (EEG: individual-band filter -> Hilbert -> downsample -> shared
band-pass; HRV: downsample -> shared band-pass), *then* segmented to a film
window taken from Stage 1's already-QC'd `film_start_s`/`film_end_s` -- so all
filter/Hilbert edge transients fall in the discarded pre/post margins and
inter-film gaps, not inside the retained window. See
`DTF_analysis_notes/pipeline_plan.md` Stage 2 and `src/design.py` for the
underlying functions.

Writes one file per dyad x film to `Interbrain_ffDTF_analysis/02_envelopes/`:
`<dyad_id>_<film>.nc` (xarray.DataArray, dims (variable, time), physical
amplitude, not z-scored -- z-scoring is a Stage 3 concern), a
`stage02_manifest.csv` (one row per included dyad x film, written or
skipped-with-reason), and a QC gate (`qc/*.png` figures + `envelopes_gate.html`
index). QC plots z-score every variable first (plotting only, never persisted)
so the EEG envelope and raw IBI -- which differ by orders of magnitude in
physical units -- are visually comparable.
